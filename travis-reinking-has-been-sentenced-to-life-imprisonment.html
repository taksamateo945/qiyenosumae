On April 22, 2018, the incident started just after 3.20 a.m. He left the scene when a client named James Shaw Jr. attempted to steal his firearm, sparking a search for him.&nbsp;The relatives of the four victims testified before the jury throughout the trial. All of the victims were under the age of 30.&nbsp;The two men killed outside the restaurant were Waffle House employee Taurean Sanderlin, 29, and customer Joe R. Perez, 20.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Travis-Reinking-1.jpg alt="Travis Reinking " width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Travis Reinking also killed two people inside the bar: Akilah DaSilva, 23, a college student and musician, and DeEbony Groves, 21, a college student majoring in social work who was going out with her sorority sisters.&nbsp;Patricia Perez said that her son would have been 24 this year.
