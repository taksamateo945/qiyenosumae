Fondly referred to as the “Godmother of Soul”, Patti has loved her adopted children in the very same way she loved her biological child. Over the years, she has raised them to become very responsible men and women in society.</p><h2><strong>Zuri Kye Edwards Is Patti LaBelle’s Only Biological Child</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> July 17, 1973</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 50 years old</li><li><strong>Father:</strong> Armstead Edwards</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Talent manager</li></ul><p>Zuri Kye Edwards is the only biological son of Patti LaBelle and her ex-husband, Armstead Edwards. Zuri was born on July 17, 1973, and is now 50 years old. He was born about four years after his parents got married. According to reports, Zuri was born in the United States. However, it is not clear what part of the USA, he was born in.</p><p>What is clear, however, is that he had a great upbringing and had the best of what every child could hope to have. At the time he was born, his famous mother had already become a successful musician and so he was apparently born into privilege. He would often follow his mother on the road when she toured and saw firsthand how things were run in the music business while still a child.</p><p>Details about the schools that Zuri Kye Edwards attended are not very clear but it is believed that he had access to the best school money could afford considering the son of whom he is. Growing up, he became very fond of his mother and was always seen beside her. Also, the fact that he grew up watching his mother perform at shows and star in movies, made him develop some interest in the entertainment industry.</p><p>But, even though he developed an interest in music early in his life, Zuri Kye did not follow in his mother’s footsteps in pursuing a career as a singer in the music industry. Instead, he took a different path; he actually forged his own career path by becoming a talent manager, helping artists build their careers and reach their full potential.</p><h3><strong>He Is Now His Mother’s Manager</strong></h3><p>Not only is Zuri Kye Edwards a talent manager, but he also has, as a matter of fact, even taken on the role of being his mother’s manager, navigating her career and helping her stay relevant in the ever-changing music industry. Zuri Kye became his mother’s manager after she parted ways with his father, Edwards, and he has been going great in the role.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/Patti1.jpg><p>According to our findings, Zuri Kye’s relationship with his mother has not always been smooth sailing, but they have managed to maintain a healthy and productive work relationship. Patti LaBelle herself once acknowledged, during an <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">interview with Closer Weekly</a>, that working with her son can be challenging because sometimes he hurts her by always being brutally honest and this can lead to fights. However, she also explained that she has come to realize that at the end of the day, he gives her the best advice ever and is never going to lead her wrong.</p><p>Without a doubt, one of the biggest fears of celebrity kids is that they would never escape the shadows of their famous parents when they venture out to make a name for themselves. Zuri is well aware of this. But, despite the challenges of growing up in the shadow of a famous mother, he has been able to forge his own path and has built a successful career, helping artists reach their full potential and bringing his mother’s music to new audiences.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that despite his success as a talent manager, Zuri Kye Edwards has largely stayed out of the public eye, choosing to focus on his work in managing people. However, he has made occasional appearances on the big screen, supporting his mother in her endeavors. In the 2015 TV series Patti LaBelle’s Place,&nbsp;Zuri Kye appeared as a guest, joining his mother in entertaining and cooking for their guests. This was a testament to their close relationship and the love they have for each other.</p><p>Zuri Kye also appeared in the 2000s docu-series titled Journeys in Black, which chronicled the lives of famous African Americans, including Kirk Franklin, father of Kerrion Franklin. Zuri Kye was able to share his insights on the experiences of growing up in a famous family and the challenges of navigating the entertainment industry. He portrayed his mother in an awesome light, talking about what a wonderful person she has always been.</p><p>In 1987, Zuri Kye was also featured in the documentary series Biography,&nbsp;which detailed the lives of historical figures and celebrities. This was another platform where he was able to share his unique perspective on growing up with a famous mother and the impact it had on his life.</p><p>But, despite his occasional appearances on screen, Zuri Kye’s primary focus remains on his work as a talent manager, helping artists reach their full potential and make their mark in the music industry. His dedication to his work and his mother’s career is a testament to the love and support he has for his family, and his contributions have helped ensure that Patti LaBelle remains a beloved icon in the music industry.</p><h3><strong>Zuri Kye Edwards Is Married To Lona Azami</strong></h3><p>Zuri Kye Edwards is currently a married man. He is married to a woman called Lona Azami. Although information about where they met and started their relationship are not clear, details we gleaned from Lona’s Instagram page reveal that they got married on the 11th of October 2014.</p><p>The couple has remained together ever since and it appears that their love seems to be growing every day. A quick look at Lona’s Instagram page shows that he and his wife are deeply into each other. They regularly take vacations and spend lots of time with each other. Lona has described Zuri as her ‘entire world’.</p><p>Together, the couple now has three children; two daughters named Gia and Leyla, and a son called Zuri Jr. Their daughter Gia was born on March 3, 2015, while Leyla was born on September 15, 2017, and ZURI Jr. was born in December 2021.</p><p>Patti LaBelle, who is clearly a proud grandmother, announced the birth of Zuri on social media, sharing an adorable picture of the newborn. She described Zuri Jr. as “one of the best gifts ever” of her holiday season, highlighting the strong bond she has with her grandchildren. In a 2018 interview, Patti opened up about how the presence of her grandchildren has changed her holiday celebrations.</p><p>With Gia already three years old at the time, Patti revealed that her granddaughter loved helping her cook in the kitchen. She also shared that she enjoyed letting her grandchildren “make a fool out of her,” saying that they were free to play with her jewelry and other belongings, even if it meant breaking things. This shows the close relationship between Patti and her grandchildren, and the joy they bring to her life.</p><p>While Zuri Kye Edwards’ personal life remains mostly private, it is clear that he values family and cherishes his role as a husband and father. His dedication to his family is reflected in the close bond they share with his mother, Patti LaBelle, who is a prominent figure in their lives. Together, they continue to make memories and build a legacy of love and support for generations to come</p><h2><strong>Who Are Patti LaBelle’s Adopted Children?</strong></h2><p>As we have already mentioned, Patti Labelle has adopted other children apart from her biological con, Zuri Kye Wedwards. But who are they, where did they come from, and what do they do for a living?</p><p>Let’s take a look at their lives.</p><h3><strong>Dodd Stocker-Edwards</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Father:</strong> Armstead Edwards</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Businessman (Re-Founder of PUMP DOG Performance Apparel)</li></ul><p>Dodd Stocker-Edwards is the first adopted child of Patti LaBelle. He is quite a fascinating figure whose personal background is shrouded in mystery. Despite extensive research, very little information is available regarding his original place of birth, date of birth, or even the circumstances surrounding his adoption by Patti.</p><p>It is not known whether Dodd was adopted before or after Patti’s biological son, Zuri Kye Edwards, was born. Additionally, it is unclear if he is older or younger than Zuri Kye, as his exact date of birth remains unknown. Some reports have claimed that he was born in 1973, the same year Zuri was born, but this claim has not been independently verified.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/Dodd-Stocker-Edwards.jpg><p>What is evident, however, is that Dodd grew up in a comfortable and nurturing environment, thanks to his adoptive mother’s wealth and resources. It is noteworthy that Dodd Stocker-Edwards was adopted while Patti LaBelle was still married to her former husband, Armstead Edwards. The adoption of Dodd was completed through a joint effort by the couple. But, how they went about the whole process is not certain.</p><p>While details about Dodd’s early education are scarce, it is believed that he attended the University of North Texas, where he received quality education that laid the foundation for his success today. Following this, Dodd Stocker-Edwards has gone on to do well for himself career-wise. According to our findings, he has made a name for himself in the professional world, having served as the General Manager of Philadelphia Sports Clubs from January 2018 to October 2018. During his tenure, he was known for his exceptional leadership skills and was highly respected by his colleagues and peers.</p><p>Following his stint at Philadelphia Sports Clubs, Dodd-Stocker went on to serve as the Director of Marketing at Global Cure CBD Wellness Centers from October 2018 to November 2019. His marketing expertise and strategic vision helped the company establish a strong foothold in the competitive wellness industry.</p><p>Currently, Dodd-Stocker is the Re-Founder of PUMP DOG Performance Apparel, a position that allows him to draw upon his extensive business experience to lead the company to new heights of success. Despite the mysteries surrounding his personal life, it is clear that Dodd-Stocker is a talented and accomplished individual who has made significant contributions to the world of business and sports.</p><p>Regarding Dodd-Stocker’s personal life, very little information is available. Despite being a successful businessman he is a figure whose personal life remains shrouded in mystery. While some reports suggest that he is a married man, little is known about his spouse or their relationship. Similarly, while he is believed to be a father, details about his children have yet to be uncovered.</p><p>Whether by choice or circumstance, he has managed to keep many details of his life private, leaving fans and admirers to speculate about his family and personal relationships. But, despite the lack of information about his personal life, it is known that Dodd-Stocker currently resides in Greater Philadelphia, where he oversees the day-to-day operations of PUMP DOG Performance Apparel.</p><h3><strong>Stanley Stocker-Edwards</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Father:</strong> Armstead Edwards</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> U.S. Attorney</li></ul><p>Stanley Stocker-Edwards is the second adopted child of Patti LaBelle and Armstead Edwards. According to some reports, he is also the biological brother of Dodd Stocker-Edwards. Reports also have it that both Stanley and Dodd were adopted together at the same time from their biological parents by Patti and Edwards. However, details about where exactly they were born as well as who their biological family are, remain scarce at the moment.</p><p>What is clear is that Stanley, along with Dodd, grew up in a privileged and luxurious environment provided to them by their famous adoptive mother, Patti LaBelle. Some reports say Stanley and his siblings were regularly taken on vacations and sometimes went with Patti on her tours.</p><p>Exact details are scarce about what Stanley’s early life was like, however, it has been reported that he received an excellent education. He developed an interest in law while still very young and decided to study it. While specifics about his early schooling remain unknown, our findings show that he did attend the famous Harvard Law School, a prestigious institution, befitting his privileged background.</p><p>Following his education, Stanley has gone on to achieve great success in his professional life. According to our findings, he is now a qualified lawyer and currently works as an attorney at the prestigious law firm of Covington and Burling LLP in Washington D.C. This is a testament to his hard work and dedication, as well as his natural talent for law.</p><p>Stanley’s success as an attorney is undoubtedly due in part to his privileged upbringing, which gave him access to the resources and opportunities needed to excel academically. However, it is also a testament to his own hard work and determination to succeed. His position at Covington and Burling LLP is highly respected, and he is known for his expertise in a wide range of legal fields.</p><h3><strong>Stanley Dated Michelle Obama At Harvard Law School</strong></h3><p>Despite his successful career as an attorney, Stanley Stocker-Edwards remains an extremely private individual. As a result, very little is known about his personal life, including details about whether he is married or not. It is, however, widely believed that he is a married man at the moment, but it is not clear who his wife is or whether he has any kids.</p><p>Following his preference for staying out of the public eye, Stanley does not have any social media accounts, which makes it challenging to uncover information about his personal life. However, there is one notable chapter in Stanley’s personal life that has been made public. It has been reported that he previously dated Michelle Obama, the former First Lady of the United States.</p><p>According to the authorized biography called “Michelle Obama: A Life,” the two met while studying at Harvard Law School and began dating during their time there. Although it is unclear when exactly they started dating, their relationship is said to have ended before they graduated from law school.</p><p>While their romance was brief and ended many years ago, the revelation of Stanley’s past relationship with Michelle Obama has brought him some attention in the media. Nevertheless, he has remained tight-lipped about their relationship and has not made any public comments regarding their time together.</p><h3><strong>William Holte</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Father</strong>: Armstead Edwards</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Unclear</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/William-Holte.jpg><p>William Holte is the third adopted son of Patti LaBelle. Interestingly he is also her nephew who came into her life when her sister died. According to our findings, Patti once had a sister whose name was Jackie Holte. Reports show that Jackie was married during her lifetime and had two children. Unfortunately, Jackie passed away in 1989, leaving her two children without a mother. Being a loving and caring aunt, Patti decided to step in and adopt her sister’s kids, including the man now known as William Holte.</p><p>Growing up under the care of his famous aunt and adoptive mother, William Holte was fortunate enough to receive all the love and attention any child could ask for. According to reports, he had access to the best schools and everything he needed to succeed in life. However, the exact details of his education are not clear, including where he went to school and what he studied.</p><p>William is one of the quieter sons of Patti LaBelle and a lot of information about his life is hidden. Despite being in the public eye due to his connection with Patti LaBelle, he has managed to keep his personal life private. Not much is known about his current occupation or his daily activities, and he appears to have made concerted efforts to keep a low profile. However, in 2020, he made headlines after he became embroiled in a social media controversy involving former Pennsylvania Republican congressional candidate Dean Browning.</p><p>The drama began when Dean Browning posted a tweet that appeared to be from a gay Black man, but which was actually from his own Twitter account. Internet sleuths quickly discovered the deception, but Browning denied it was his own tweet, claiming he was quoting a message he had received from a man named Dan Purdy. However, when Purdy was revealed to be a fake account, Browning was forced to admit the tweet was his own. In the midst of the controversy, William Holte appeared on social media claiming to be Dan Purdy, which only added to the confusion.</p><p>Although the situation with Dean Browning and Dan Purdy was quickly resolved, William Holte has not made any public comments about the incident. Since then, he has remained out of the public eye, and it is unclear what he is currently doing with his life. Despite his brief moment of fame, William appears to prefer a quiet, private life away from the spotlight.</p><p>It is not clear if William Holte is married at the moment as details about this part of his life are out of public reach.</p><h3><strong>Stayce Holte</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Father:</strong> Armstead Edwards</li><li><strong>Occupation: </strong>Unclear</li></ul><p>Stayce Holte is the second child of Patti LaBelle’s sister, Jackie Holte, whom she adopted alongside her brother William after their mother/Patti’s sister died. Patti welcomed the two children with open arms and gave them the love and care they needed to thrive. Apparently, Stayce grew up in a luxurious and loving environment, surrounded by her famous aunt and her siblings.</p><p>According to our findings, Stayce and Patti have always had a special bond, and Patti once called Stayce her “favorite person.” Stayce often refers to Patti as her “aunty mommy”. She is extremely close to Patti, and when she went through a tough breakup with a partner, reports say it was Patti that Srayce turned to for comfort. And Patti did a good job comforting her.</p><p>Although details about Stayce’s education are not readily available, it is reported that she attended prestigious schools like her siblings. Information about her career is also scarce, and it’s unclear what she does for a living. However, Stayce is not a very private person and has been vocal on social media. In June 2019, she revealed on Instagram that she has bipolar disorder and has survived a suicide attempt.</p><p>She used her platform to advocate for kindness and encourage people to be more understanding of mental health issues. Her bravery in sharing her struggles has earned her praise and admiration from fans and supporters. She also shares a lot of throwback photos of herself in her youth, discussing her life and lessons. She also shares photos of her biological mother, Jackie, on Instagram, and talks very fondly about her.</p><p>On Patti LaBelle’s 75th birthday, Stayce wrote a touching tribute to her. In it, she expressed her gratitude for the love and support she had received from Patti, revealing that Patti loves her like a mom and that they fight and laugh like sisters. She also said Patti spoils her like an auntie, and that they talk late into the night and share secrets like besties. Obviously, the two women are very close.</p><p>At the moment, it is not clear if Stayce is married. What is clear is that despite her struggles, she remains a strong and resilient woman, thanks in part to the love and guidance of her family, especially her devoted aunt Patti LaBelle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmoaenYrqiuthmmqGhnJm%2FprqMnaaeq12lrrXAyGajmpqVobmmecearZ5lkaOxbsPHqGSaqpViwamx2Gg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ashley-harkleroad.html><span>←</span><span>Ashley Harkleroad- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Ethnicity</span></a>
