Gina was the only person who was on the show, and there was an apparent rift between the two, and then at the start of the year, the couple decided they needed a divorce. The couple finalized their divorce on 8 July 2019, but in the most recent episode of the series, Spilling Tea and Throwing Shade, it came to light; the former husband and wife still saw each other.</p><h2>Gina Kirschenheiter, Ex-Husband Matthew Kirschenheiter, and A Bar Kiss</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2019/10/Gina-Kirschenheiter-and-her-ex-husband-Matthew-Kirschenheiter-got-divorced-in-2019-and-were-still-seen-together..jpg alt="Gina Kirschenheiter and her ex-husband Matthew Kirschenheiter got divorced in 2019 and were still seen together." width=450 height=338 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Gina Kirschenheiter and her ex-husband Matthew Kirschenheiter got divorced in 2019 and were still seen together.</strong><br><strong>Source: The Blast</strong></p><p>The couple filed for divorce at the start of the year, Matt and Gina cited irreconcilable differences as the cause of why they need to be away from each other. Their divorce was finalized on 8 July 2019, and even after the couple was separated, the duo was still together as they said they needed to for the three kids they share.</p><p>After the scuffle, early September, the former husband and wives were supposed to be on the outs, but then this week, the reality star was seen making out with her ex-husband by one of <strong>Tamra Judge</strong>’s friends. Tamra let her know after she showed up in the morning hungover.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2019/10/Tamra-Judge-found-out-about-Gina-kissing-her-ex-husband..jpg alt="Tamra Judge found out about Gina kissing her ex-husband." width=450 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Tamra Judge found out about Gina kissing her ex-husband.</strong><br><strong>Source: OK Magazine</strong></p><p>Tamra talked about the kiss, but at first, Gina denied it, which led to a confession later on where she admitted to meeting her ex-husband and making out in the bar. Other RHOC cast members tried to tell her he is not the man for her after he cheated on her and all the legal struggles the couple faced, but Gina was unsure about it all.</p><p>Gina’s daughter Sienna was diagnosed with motor delays, and this was causing her to rethink the relationship with her ex-husband, and she was thinking of letting him back into their lives. “Clearly things are slipping, because…it's overwhelming, and I'm just not enough for everybody,” the mother of four shared.</p><p>After some more digging, the housewives were able to get the truth out of her about the couple having sex. Then, Gina told her friends she might be able to make it work with Matthew again, but she was unsure if she couple trust him again.</p><h2>Gina Kirschenheiter’s DUI Arrest and Matt Kirschenheiter’s Domestic Violence Arrest</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2019/10/Gina-Kirschenheiter-was-arrested-for-a-DUI..png alt="Gina Kirschenheiter was arrested for a DUI." width=450 height=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Gina Kirschenheiter was arrested for a DUI.</strong><br><strong>Source: Bravo TV</strong></p><p>Gina Kirschenheiter was stopped by police officers in Rancho Santa Margarita, California when she was suspected of a traffic violation.

The arrest took place on 22 June, and soon after the arrest, Gina filed for a restraining order.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2019/10/Matthew-Kirschenheiter-was-arrested-on-22-June-2019-for-domestic-violence..jpg alt="Matthew Kirschenheiter was arrested on 22 June 2019 for domestic violence." width=450 height=556 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Matthew Kirschenheiter was arrested on 22 June 2019 for domestic violence.</strong><br><strong>Source: E-News</strong></p><p>The case for domestic violence was herd on 6 September 2019, where he entered the plea of not guilty, but the restraining order filed against him was approved, and he was told to stay at least 100 feet of distance away from her. Seeing how the couple was making out in public, it seems no one really cares for the restraining order any more.</p><h2>Gina Kirschenheiter's New Boyfriend Travis Mullen</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2019/10/Gina-Kirschenheiters-new-boyfriend-making-his-first-appearance-in-her-Instagram.png alt="Gina Kirschenheiter's new boyfriend making his first appearance in her Instagram." width=450 height=449 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Gina Kirschenheiter's new boyfriend making his first appearance on her Instagram.</strong><br><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>After the arrest of her ex-husband, the RHOC cast member was seen with a new man in September. The two were seen laughing and sharing a good time when Gina uploaded the photo of the couple together for the first time on 30 September 2019.</p><p>The reason we've not seen the couple with Gina's children is because of the custody agreement which does not allow the introduction of any new man into their children's life unless the relationship is extremely serious. The mystery man was identified as <strong>Travis Mullen</strong> and in another batch of photos shared by the reality star showed the two were getting close.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2019/10/Gina-Kirschenheiter-was-seen-kising-her-ex-boyfriend-and-there-is-no-telling-how-her-relationship-with-her-new-boyfriend-will-go..png alt="Gina Kirschenheiter was seen kising her ex-boyfriend and there is no telling how her relationship with her new boyfriend will go." width=450 height=565 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Gina Kirschenheiter was seen kissing her ex-husband and there is no telling how her relationship with her new boyfriend will go.</strong><br><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The photos were uploaded two weeks ago and now Gina admitted to sleeping with her ex-husband after kissing him in a bar.
