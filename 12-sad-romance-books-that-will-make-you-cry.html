Sometimes, A is a boy while other times it is a girl. A can also take up a body in any skin color and size. It replaces the hosts’ consciousness and memories with its own even though it can tap into the memories of the person it is occupying at the time. A, however, strives to respect the people it possesses and chooses to stick to their routines.</p><p>Every Day starts with A waking up in the body of a 16-year-old teenager named Justin. As has always been the case, A carries on with Justin’s routine, going to school, where he meets up with his girlfriend, Rhiannon. A taps into Justin’s memories and finds out that he and his girlfriend were having some issues. They end up going to talk about things and open up to each other, although A is very limited in what it shares.</p><p>For the first time in its life, A feels a connection with Rhiannon. It had never felt this way before and works to come in contact with Rhiannon in the days later when it inhabits other bodies. When in different bodies in the next days, A is able to convince Rhiannon that the person she had a deep conversation with was not Justin. It is able to get her to understand the phenomenon it is going through of having to occupy different bodies every 24 hours.</p><p>But while she understands A and what it might be going through, she is convinced that it would be impossible to have a relationship with A as it is always changing bodies and gender. A is therefore stuck with having to chase Rhiannon with each passing day.</p><h3><strong>12.
