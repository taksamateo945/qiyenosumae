"Honestly, she is entitled to say whatever she wants about herself, just as long as she doesn't try to attack my character. When she starts talking about my personal life, that's where I draw the line."</p><p>She blasted him in a recent RadarOnlne interview and, he claims, has continued to slam him on her fan site.</p><p>"I am absolutely 100 percent positive that it is her and her best friend," he tells <strong>Us</strong>. "I think it's pretty unfortunate that she is resorting to such measures to promote herself and put me down by writing a blog, acting as if it is some random fan in the middle of America."</p><p>How did things get so ugly?</p><p>Kovacs and Kitt continued to be romantic after they were voted off the show.&nbsp;On the show's finale, she said they ended things because he "wanted a casual relationship, and I don't do casual relationships."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He tells <strong>Us</strong> he never misled her.</p><p>"When we got out of the house, it was just one of those things where we realized that it wasn't going to work out," he tells <strong>Us</strong>. "But when she started watching the show, that's when she kind of flipped out on me and saw the things that were said in interviews. She completely lost her mind!" True, he says he does "get attention" from women, but that doesn't make him a bad guy.</p><p>"I know a lot of personal things about Elizabeth that she would never want to be public knowledge," he tells <strong>Us</strong>. "I would never stoop to that level, and I would never do that to her."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2BjKmYnatdoLy3rcKsZJ6kma%2Buo7HToWShmaNir6axzWarq5mjnbavs4ymnGannmLBqbGMoqWtnaKjsrV5kWloaWlnbg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christian-von-koenigsegg-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Christian von Koenigsegg Net Worth Reveal</span></a>
