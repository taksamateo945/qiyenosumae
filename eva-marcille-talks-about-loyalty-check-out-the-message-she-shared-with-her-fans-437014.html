‘Be loyal to yourself🌻Fake people will always give you a real reason to cut them off 👀 @trentshelton
Listen. These are some of the truest words you’ll hear. Everybody isn’t your friend. Hard times will always reveal that. Some people are around you because of what surrounds your life, not because of what’s in your heart."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Everybody isn’t your friend. Hard times will always reveal that. Some people are around you because of what surrounds your life, not because of what’s in your heart. Ask yourself this MAGIC QUESTION. “If all I had to offer was friendship, who would still be around?” Everybody in your circle might not be in your corner. Jealousy lives a lot closer than you think. Appreciate the real ones in your life. And remember, real situations will always expose fake people. Pay attention. TAG YOUR REAL FRIENDS TO THIS VIDEO!’ Eva captioned her post.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CFKGOy0lpj3/</p><p>Someone said: ‘This is hard to watch Bc I’ve had to accept some hard truths about people I thought were my friends.
