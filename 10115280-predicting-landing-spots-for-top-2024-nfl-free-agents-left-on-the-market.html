It's even more shocking that the former Denver Broncos safety has yet to find a new home.</p><p>Simmons should still have plenty gas left in the tank as he gears up for his ninth NFL season. While he's now on the wrong side of 30, he was just named a second-team All-Pro for the fourth time and earned the second Pro Bowl nod of his career in 2023.</p><p>With career totals of 604 tackles, 30 interceptions, five forced fumbles, 4.5 sacks and three fumble recoveries, Simmons is a versatile defensive back who can cover well, create turnovers and tackle at a high level. He should have little issue contributing at a high level for plenty of NFL defenses in 2024.</p><p>However, Simmons' price tag could keep some teams out of the running. Denver parted with him to save $14.5 million in much-needed cap space, but <a href=# rel=noopener>Spotrac</a> still estimates he'll make $11.1 million annually on his next contract.</p><p>The Philadelphia Eagles look to be the ideal landing spot for Simmons. They have the fourth-most cap space leaguewide ($32.4 million) and would be a great fit for him schematically.</p><p>Simmons was already successful earlier in his career working with new Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who was Denver's head coach between 2019-21. The Eagles also need more veteran talent at the safety spot.</p><p>If the season began today, 2023 third-rounder Sydney Brown and 2022 undrafted free-agent pickup Reed Blankenship might start ahead of a pair of unproven talents in Mekhi Garner and Tristin McCollum. While C.J. Gardner-Johnson could be in the mix as well, he'll likely see plenty of time at nickel corner.</p><p>Simmons is a clear upgrade here and would make perfect sense for a team that needs more veteran contributors as it looks to bounce back after its nightmarish finish to last season.</p><p><b>Top Landing Spot: Philadelphia Eagles</b></p><p><i>NFL salary-cap data courtesy of </i><a href=# rel=noopener><i>Spotrac</i></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWp%2FeXyMqamenJmYwaq6xmajmqaUnruoedKppq2rXZu8s3nTqKdmamBngW66xaVkn6qVmnqis8Snq6xlnJqztXnOp2StoJViuqK%2Byp6r</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patrick-michael-james-sajak-wiki-bio-age-height-job-dating-girlfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Patrick Michael James Sajak Age, Height, Wikipedia, Girlfriend</span></a>
