Andy Lyons/Getty ImagesLast year's Derby provided one of the most stunning results in the history of the event as 80-1 long shot Rich Strike came away with the victory at Churchill Downs.
He was entered into the race just 30 minutes ahead of the Friday deadline but still managed to beat out an impressive field.
