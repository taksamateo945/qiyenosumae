The bad news: <strong>Mattie Lynn Breaux</strong> morphed into her drunken alter ego, Martha, and ruined <strong>Walt Windham's</strong> chance of having his second threesome in two days. Get caught up on what might be the craziest episode of Party Down South yet in the recap below, and don't say we didn't warn you.</p><p><strong>Lauren Reunited With Her Boyfriend</strong></p><p>Reunited and it feels so good! Lauren broke up with her boyfriend last week, which resulted in her smoking on a Lazy Boy and feeling a general sense of ennui. But fear not, <strong>Ryan "Daddy" Richards</strong> saved the day by encouraging Lauren to "go out and find some young stud and ride the s––t out of him." No, Lauren didn't take Daddy's advice, but she did forgive her man when he called her up to apologize.</p><p><strong>This Just In: Daddy Can Read the Future</strong></p><p>Daddy predicted the future this week, and he might be a prophet. This turnt-up singleton had a dream that ended up becoming a reality, but we'll let him do the talking: "In my dream last night, you hauled in two marlins," Daddy told Walt (side note: "marlins" = women). "It's not a dream, Walter, it's a vision."</p><p>Later, Daddy described his talent to cameras, saying, "I'm one of the few people in this world that if it's gotta do with banging, pretzeling, [or] just straight down partying, I can read the future."</p><p><strong>Walt Had a Threesome, the World Goes Blind</strong></p><p>Walt managed to reel in not one, but two "marlins" at the bar, and after cooing "y'all cool to have a threesome?" (Shakespeare-level stuff right there), he took them home for some after-hours fun. Things got slightly weird when Daddy walked in, but don't worry, he ended up passed out in a bed with <strong>Josh Murray</strong>.&nbsp;Just another Thursday night!</p><p><strong>Daddy Attempted to Have a Threesome, Failed Miserably</strong></p><p>Despite Daddy optimistically announcing that "somebody's about to get in the pretzel tonight," he failed to impress the two girls he took home. In fact, one of them got lost in the house and presumably spent her night hanging out with the local goats. Daddy's thoughts on the matter? "Did Mattie kill her?"</p><p><strong>Shudder: Mattie Becomes Martha</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Oh hi, Martha! Despite promising herself that she wouldn't drink, Mattie did one too many shots and morphed into her angry alter ego, Martha, who was dead set on ruining Walt's chances of threesome 2.0. Not only did Martha confront Walt's date about having a boyfriend, she yelled, "Get the f––k out my house" before walking into Walt's arm and spilling a perfectly good beer all over the place.</p><p>So did Martha turn back into Mattie and apologize? We'll have to wait until next week to find out, but let's end things on a positive note: Lyle A. Boudreaux wants to propose to his girlfriend!</p><p>Watch Party Down South Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on CMT.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOqZirrKlisbDDzWaqqK2knXqzscKap2avkaHBbsPIp5uhmZ1itaK%2FjJpkraCimrK0u8yeZGtoYWp%2BcYU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rock-of-love-where-are-they-now-rock-of-love-season-1-cast-latest-update.html><span>←</span><span>Rock Of Love Where Are They Now?
