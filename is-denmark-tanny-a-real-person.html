As well, Do Sarah and John stay together?
The short answer is yes, John B and Sarah do end up together by the end of Outer Banks season 2. However, they also break up earlier on in the season. Both parties simply have too much baggage to be together, with Sarah upset over her father’s death and John B almost happy about it."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

While there isn’t an actual ship called the Royal Merchant, there was one called the Merchant Royal. Also dubbed the “El Dorado of the seas,” the Merchat Royal sunk 200 years earlier and in a different location than than its fictionalized counterpart — specifically on September 23, 1641, off the coast of England.</p><p>How is Pope’s grandma related to Denmark Tanny? Later on in episode 6, we find out that Pope is a direct descendant of Denmark from his great-grandmother, Meemaw.
