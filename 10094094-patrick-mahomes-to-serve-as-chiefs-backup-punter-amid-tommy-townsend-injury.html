"He could do it. He shows me all the time he's out there [at practice]. Boom.

He went through the first two days of practice before being listed as a limited participant on Wednesday with a knee issue.</p><p>The Chiefs officially listed Townsend as questionable for their Thursday night matchup against the Broncos, but Pete Sweeney of Arrowhead Pride noted during warmups before kickoff it seemed like the 26-year-old's knee was doing fine.</p>Pete Sweeney <span class=acct>@pgsween</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Watching Tommy Townsend (left knee) go through warmups, I think he's going to be fine to go.</p><p>Based on the results from the game, Townsend didn't seem to have any lingering pain.

He averaged 38.7 yards per punt on 27 attempts as a senior in 2013-14.</p><p>Given how careful the Chiefs are with Mahomes, including not using him on sneaks after he <a href=# rel=noopener>dislocated his patella</a> on that play and missed two games in 2019, it's hard to believe head coach Andy Reid would let him actually let him punt the ball and leave his legs open for a defender trying to block it.</p><p>But it would be interesting to see Mahomes get an opportunity to punt in an NFL game since it was part of his arsenal as a high-school star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWl9eoCMqZitqpmYuG65wKGmpp2jYsGwedKeqa%2BdXZbAbq%2FHopyfq12XrqS31Klkqa2eqbKzecCmoJ1lpKS6rsWMraawpqOau6V5yKehrqqp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nba-hoopgrids-answers-for-october-10-all-answers-and-hints-for-basketball-grid.html><span>←</span><span>NBA HoopGrids answers for October 10: All answers and hints for Basketball Grid</span></a>
