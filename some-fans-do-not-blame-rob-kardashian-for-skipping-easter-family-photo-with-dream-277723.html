He’s still uncomfortable in his own skin, and though he loves to be with his family, he likes to do it privately. Rob is at home most of the time.”</p><p>The person added: “Dream is seen around the neighborhood on walks with Rob’s mom Kris [Jenner] or nannies, however, that doesn’t mean Rob isn’t hands on. He’s a wonderful dad; he just doesn’t go out much at all. He has struggled a lot to get to a more confident and secure place with his looks and it’s hard for him. They do their best to always include him and worry about him constantly. His family is very supportive, and they respect his feelings though they wish he’d do more things publicly with them.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Although some fans do miss seeing more of him, most agree that Rob is doing the right thing if he has trouble with fame.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejpLqmecWapaxllKR6r7vTZpmlmZ2aerO7wWaimqqUlsCptcCnZJ%2BnomLArLXPqaCnn12arrTAxKtkn5mdnrm6ec%2Bhpq2nXay2tbSMnamemZ1if3iDlmtqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kuwtk-kim-kardashian-to-continue-her-involvement-with-the-prison-reform-regardless-of-who-wins-the-presidential-elections-430549.html><span>←</span><span>KUWTK: Kim Kardashian To Continue Her Involvement With The Prison Reform Regardless Of Who Wins The</span></a>
