She falls victim to society’s expectations in their town of Seabrook. But deep down she has an individuality that is wanting to come out, just like everyone else.</p><p><strong>What was the audition process like?</strong></p><p>I had an audition in Toronto and then for the callback we had to learn a dance routine to show the director and producers. They put us in different groups of Aceys (Lacey, Tracey, Stacey) and that’s how we were formed!</p><p><strong>Had you ever done any cheerleading before the movie?</strong></p><p>I did some cheerleading in High School but my main background was in dance and acting. So being able to act like a cheerleader and fake it was the easy part!</p><p><strong>Can you talk us through what the recording process was like to record the songs for the movie and how did you find it?</strong></p><p>We recorded the songs at a recording studio during the rehearsal period so that while filming we could use the real track with our voices. It was a very exciting process because so much went into it, that being able to listen to it and watch it was so interesting and even emotional.</p><p><strong>Who would you love to star in a movie with?</strong></p><p>I really love Michelle Williams and Charlize Theron. They’re such chameleons which I think is the ultimate goal as an actor. Although, literally everyone tells me I look like Amanda Seyfried so I wouldn’t be mad at playing her sister!</p><p><strong>You post regularly on Instagram, what type of accounts do you like following on there?</strong></p><p>I mostly follow my friends! But I also follow some celebrities and fashion accounts, as well as some interior design and cool homes accounts!</p><p><strong>What do you like to do when you’re not working?</strong></p><p>I like to have some fun times with my friends and I also like to hit the gym!&nbsp;<span class=im><br></span></p><span class=im><span class=im><br><strong>What would be your dream role?</strong></span></span>&nbsp;<p>My dream role would be a kick-butt type character. &nbsp;Like a&nbsp;<a href=#>Tomb Raider</a>&nbsp;vibe or even a Hit-Girl vibe from the movie Kick-Ass. I think it would be really cool to do your own stunts and look like a badass on screen!&nbsp;<span class=im><br></span></p><p><strong><span class=im>What can fans expect next from you?</span></strong></p><p>I was in a pilot that premiered in October that we’re waiting on to see if it will go to series. If it does, look out for Dark Haven High!</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Zombies airs on the Disney Channel in the US on Friday, Feb. 16 at 8/7c</strong></p><p><strong>Are you excited to see Zombies?
