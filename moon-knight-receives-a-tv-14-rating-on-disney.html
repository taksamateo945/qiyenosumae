<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Moon Knight Receives a TV-14 Rating on Disney+</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong><a href=#>Moon Knight</a></strong> is set to be rated TV-14 to fall in line with previous MCU series entries. <a href=#>Moon Knight stars Oscar Isaac</a> as the titular superhero, a man who may or may not be marked by an Egyptian god to do his bidding on Earth as a superhero. The character of Moon Knight has been a fan favorite since he first appeared in&nbsp;Marvel comics, and many have been eagerly awaiting his debut in the MCU.</p><p>One factor that many prospective viewers have wondered about is how far Moon Knight would be able to go in terms of violent content, given its&nbsp;position within&nbsp;the&nbsp;broad all-age reaching&nbsp;MCU and&nbsp;the fact it is&nbsp;streaming on the Disney+ service, which is often associated with family entertainment. After all, Disney scrapped plans for a Lizzie McGuire reboot&nbsp;due to&nbsp;what star Hilary Duff described as differing opinions between her and the studio over&nbsp;how mature the reboot’s story would be.&nbsp;However, <a href=#>Marvel boss&nbsp;Kevin Feige</a> recently assured fans that Moon Knight would push the limits and would be a “brutal” shift in tone for the MCU.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Why Moon Knight’s Portrayal Of His Mental Illness Will Be Crucial</a></span></p><p>According to Disney+, Moon Knight will be rated TV-14. The TV-14 rating is described as Parents Strongly Cautioned and intended for children ages 14 and older in the company of an adult. This is the same rating that MCU shows like&nbsp;WandaVision, Loki, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and Hawkeye received on the Disney+ service.</p><figure class=item-img></figure><p>TV-14 is very similar to the PG-13 rating in films, so it is not&nbsp;surprising that Moon Knight has a similar rating to&nbsp;most big and small screen&nbsp;MCU installments. It should be noted that many series on Disney+ have been able to push the boundaries of the TV-14 rating, as is the case with The Simpsons, which is one of the crown jewel series streaming on the service. Similar to the recent reveal of the <a href=#>PG-13 rating for The Batman</a>,&nbsp;Moon Knight‘s is TV-14 rating&nbsp;is likely to upset some audience members who were hoping for a&nbsp;more mature&nbsp;classification. However, a rating is not always a direct indication of the material, and Moon Knight, like The Batman, is likely to be towards the more mature&nbsp;end of the TV-14 spectrum.</p><p>Moon Knight itself is expected to mark a new chapter for the MCU, which will lead to a much larger emphasis on the supernatural. This is expected to be carried into the rumored Werewolf by Night Halloween special, as well as the upcoming Blade film.&nbsp;Moon Knight‘s&nbsp;TV-14 rating, however, further&nbsp;supports speculation&nbsp;that the&nbsp;recently announced <a href=#>Netflix departure of&nbsp;Marvel shows</a>&nbsp;such as&nbsp;Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, the rights of which have all reverted to Disney,&nbsp;may be released on&nbsp;Hulu rather than the Disney+ service when they return. Many of these shows have a higher age rating given their violent and mature content, so perhaps viewers can expect&nbsp;<strong>Moon Knight </strong>to<strong>&nbsp;</strong>be a little more tame than other Marvel properties.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Moon Knight Being A Limited Series Increases The Hero’s MCU Importance</a></span></p><p>Source: Disney+</p><p><strong><span class=next-btn-text-title>Daredevil Can’t Be The Same On Disney+: How Season 4 Would Be Different</span></strong></p><p><strong class=section-sub-title>About The Author</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Richard-Fink-profile-picture.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><strong class=bio-title><br>Richard Fink<br><span class=amount>(455 Articles Published)</span><br></strong><p>Richard Fink is a news writer for Screen Rant.
