<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Kevin Federline Reminisces About &amp;quot;Whirlwind&amp;quot; Britney Spears Romance</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Britney and Kevin: No Longer Chaotic! <strong><a href=#>Britney Spears</a></strong> and ex-husband <strong><a href=#>Kevin Federline</a></strong> spent a few very tumultuous years together back in the early aughts. From their surprise wedding to their UPN reality show to their contentious divorce, custody battle, and Spears' mental breakdown, the couple's relationship was like her 2008 album — a Circus. These days, though, the craziness between them is just a memory.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Hollywood's friendliest exes</a></p><p>"That time, it's like a whirlwind,” Federline, 36, told <a href=#>Access Hollywood Live</a> hosts Billy Bush and Kit Hoover of his 2004 to 2007 marriage to the "Work Bitch" singer. "You know, you're thrown into this limelight…Everything kinda happened."</p><p>Which is not to say it was bad. They had their problems, of course, but they also had two adorable sons, <strong>Sean</strong>, 9, and <strong>Jayden</strong>, 8. (Spears, 33, gave birth to their second child two months before she filed for divorce.)</p><p>"I mean, it was a good time in my life," the aspiring DJ recalled. "We have two beautiful children. The way that everything has turned out, everybody's happy. Co-parenting is going great. I can't complain."</p><p>Indeed, despite some early fighting over the kids after their split — which culminated in the singer's 2007 meltdown, complete with a head-shaving incident and rehab — Federline and Spears seem to be in a good, peaceful place. They've worked out a schedule for the boys over the years, but they also try to be accommodating of each other's busy careers.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I had to work this weekend and go to Orange County…so they went to Vegas," he shared. "And when she has to do something and I need to keep the kids, it just works out well."</p><p>The important thing, he added, is that their sons always come first. "We talk when we need to, and it's always about the boys — mostly school stuff and making sure we stay on top of that," he explained. "It's going great. I'm in a happy place right now."</p><p>That's thanks in part to his wife <strong>Victoria Prince</strong>, a former volleyball player. The lovebirds, who married in 2013, have two daughters together, <strong>Jordan</strong>, 3, and <strong>Peyton</strong>, 10 months. Federline also has two kids, <strong>Kori</strong> and <strong>Kaleb</strong>, from his relationship with ex-girlfriend <strong>Shar Jackson</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKerpmjeqexw56ppaGemnqzscyipaKrk5rAbq3BqKytZaedtrO41qKlnWWSp7a1usSyZKyolZa%2FtHnRqKSappOaenN8kG5wbA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amy-adams.html><span>←</span><span>Amy Adams Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth</span></a>
