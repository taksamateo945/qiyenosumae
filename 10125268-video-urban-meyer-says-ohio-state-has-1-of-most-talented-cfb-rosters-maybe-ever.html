Tuimoloau, wide receiver Emeka Egbuka and running back TreVeyon Henderson.</p><p>On top of that, the Buckeyes have one of the best incoming class of recruits and transfers in the nation, ranking fifth overall, per <a href=# rel=noopener>247Sports</a>.</p><p>Ohio State's biggest additions are arguably at quarterback. as they landed Will Howard from Kansas State and Julian Sayin from Alabama.</p><p>While Sayin is likely the long-term answer, Howard is perhaps the favorite to win the starting job this season after last year's starter, Kyle McCord, transferred to Syracuse.</p><p>Howard started 27 games at KSU, and he is coming off a solid 2023 season in which he completed 61.3 percent of his passes for 2,643 yards, 24 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, while also rushing for 351 yards and nine scores.</p><p>Should he earn the starting job, Howard will have a better chance than ever before to deliver at a high level due to the amount of talent around him at OSU.</p><p>Michigan won the Big Ten each of the past three seasons and won the national championship last season, but with head coach Jim Harbaugh and many of the team's top players from last season moving on to the NFL, the Buckeyes will have a golden opportunity to return to the top of the Big Ten and potentially all of college football in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmp%2Fd4SMr6CdnZ9iwrOuwKdkpp2pmr9uv8CyqmanmJ68br%2FTmqueZZiWwG59jKidZqWfqMFuwMClnKeslZl6pLLBZqmoq6Sav7R5zJqwm51dmsOmvg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10086163-sean-tuohy-says-hes-devastated-by-michael-oher-lawsuit-alleging-false-adoption.html><span>←</span><span>Sean Tuohy Says He's 'Devastated' by Michael Oher Lawsuit Alleging False Adoption | News, Scores, Hi</span></a>
