On March 18, Taylor Swift will take the stage in Glendale, Ariz. If you were one of "The Lucky One[s]," and&nbsp;scored&nbsp;tickets, now you're faced with the question—what will you wear? With so many looks to choose from and things like practicality and uniqueness to consider, we've rounded up inspo from each era to fuel your outfit development.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span>1. Taylor Swift&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p></p><p>For the Debut era, it's all about going back to those country music boots...er...roots. Your Eras outfit inspo is coming from the "Teardrops on My Guitar" music video. Grab a green dress, the curliest hair possible (use a 1/2" curling wand for the&nbsp;best results), cowgirl boots and your fave lip gloss. A must-have accessory for this look are rhinestones to top off your killer eyeshadow. The sparkle proves Tay was bejeweled even 16 years before Midnights came out.</p><p><strong><span>2. Fearless</span></strong></p><p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.girlslife.com/posts/041/41455/erasoutfitinspofearless.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><a href=#>@taylornation</a></p><p>Harnessing the energy of the&nbsp;Fearless&nbsp;era is all about mixing the fairytale magic of&nbsp;"Love Story" and "White Horse" with the sparkly and metallic dresses from the original&nbsp;Fearless&nbsp;tour. Mix peasant blouses with sequin skirts, sparkly dresses with boots or whatever combo has you feeling like a "Superstar."</p><p><strong><span>3. Speak Now</span></strong></p><p></p><p>Before "Lavender Haze," there was "Speak Now" purple. It's the album's signature color, after all. Keep the sequin theme going in a purple sequin dress or explore the world of purple jumpsuits, rompers and matching sets. If you want to erase any confusion on what era you're aiming to represent, a purple halter dress just like the one Taylor wore on the&nbsp;Speak Now&nbsp;Tour and a big 13 painted on your hand (use non-toxic teal nail polish) will do the trick.</p><p><strong><span>4. Red</span></strong></p><p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.girlslife.com/posts/041/41455/erasoutfitinspored.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><a href=#>@brits</a></p><p>The OG&nbsp;Red&nbsp;music videos have tons&nbsp;of outfit options, and when it comes to pulling an Eras look from there, "[We] Almost Do." Instead, though, we're inspired by Taylor's look from the 2021 Brit Awards that took place one month before Taylor announced Red (Taylor's Version). A matching minty crop top and skirt adorned with sequins and paired with her signature red lip? If they were handing out awards at the Eras tour, you'd win one.</p><p><strong><span>5. 1989</span></strong></p><p></p><p>Who can forget the cinematic masterpiece that was the "Wildest Dreams" music video? From the picturesque safari landscape to the heart-wrenching storyline, Taylor showed us that the Old Hollywood aesthetic never goes out of "Style." We specifically love her premiere look. Grab a rose gold glittery dress and a classy fur stole (or full fur coat—go big!) and give yourself some fab finger waves in your hair. Watch out for the paparazzi!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6. reputation</strong></p><p></p><p>Sure, Rep brought us a slew of edgy, black outfits and hooded bodysuits that totally captured the Mother of Snakes persona Taylor adopted during the era. With this aesthetic came some top-tier music vids, including "Delicate." For a <i>reputation</i>-themed tour outfit, we're leaning into the dance-like-nobody-is-watching vibe with a teal, fringe dress just like the one from "Delicate." Trust us, you'll be looking "Gorgeous."</p><p><strong><span>7. Lover</span></strong></p><p></p><p>There are&nbsp;so many ways to slay a&nbsp;Lover-themed look—all you really need is pink, flowers, hearts, glitter or butterflies. The&nbsp;Lover&nbsp;era gave us so&nbsp;many public-appearance outfits to choose from, but the Good Morning America look said, "Choose 'ME!'" and we said, "Absolutely." Grab a sheer pink button-up, black cropped tank or camisole and sparkly shorts and get ready to scream the "Death By A&nbsp;Thousand Cuts" bridge at the top of your lungs.</p><p><strong><span>8. folklore</span></strong></p><p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.girlslife.com/posts/041/41455/erasoutfitinspofolklore.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><a href=#>@taylornation</a></p><p>You're going to have "a marvelous time" at the concert, obvi, and your outfit has to match that energy. Our&nbsp;folklore&nbsp;inspo comes from another award show slay—this time from the 2021 Grammy Awards. We're talking about none other than Taylor's gorgeous Oscar de la Renta pressed flower dress. Bonus points if you style your hair in the&nbsp;folklore&nbsp;buns.</p><p><strong><span>9. evermore</span></strong></p><p></p><p>It's a lighthearted joke among Swifties that Taylor doesn't often display her love for&nbsp;evermore&nbsp;publicly, even though many fans find the lyricism of the album to be some of her best work. With only one music video for the whole album and public appearances that crossover with the&nbsp;folklore&nbsp;and&nbsp;Red (Taylor's Version)&nbsp;eras, we're drawing inspo from a song instead: "ivy." Wear whatever makes you comfortable, as long as it's green. Then, grab some fake vines from your fave craft store and go crazy. We're talking about wrapping them around your body, putting them in your hair, all the things.</p><p><strong><span>10. <i>Midnights</i></span></strong></p><p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.girlslife.com/posts/041/41455/erasoutfitinspomidnights.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><a href=#>@taylor.x.selena</a></p><p>For&nbsp;Midnights, we're taking it back to that fateful night at the VMAs where the album was first announced. More specifically, we're drawing inspo from Taylor's after-party look. To recreate it, you'll need a navy silk dress and some adhesive stars (or get crafty and make your own). Grab any kind of puffy white jacket, sweater or coat, then paint on the showstopping red lip. The other Swifties are going to be calling you a style "Mastermind" all night.</p><p><strong><span>Keep reading Taylor content here:<br>🪩 </span></strong><a href=#><span>The movie you should watch next, based on your favorite Taylor Swift music video</span></a><br><strong><span>🪩 </span></strong><a href=#><span>Our favorite moments from the "Lavender haze" music video</span></a><br><a href=#><span>🪩</span></a>&nbsp;<a href=#>Plan your perfect weekend and we'll give you a book with a Taylor Swift-inspired title</a></p><p><strong><span>What are you planning to wear to the Eras Tour?<br>Tag us in your TikToks <a href=#>@girlslifemag</a> so we can be your personal hype women.</span></strong></p><p><span>Slider image:&nbsp;<a href=#>@taylorswift</a><br>Header image:&nbsp;<a href=#>@taylorswift</a><br>GIF via <a href=#>Giphy</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2O0qr7LrKOinpVjsLC5jqyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdnZGaBdoGOoZyrnaNixrDB0Wacq5mjYsGwwdFmpq6slp7BbrXNrKeoZZakv26x1Z6psmWklsatu9FmqrChlql6orjBrqQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-michael-carey-dj-carey-son.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Michael Carey, DJ Carey Son?
