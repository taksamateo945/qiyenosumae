The cars are normally designed as a sports car, but given the few numbers of Koenigsegg that exist today, they are only sold to a handful of billionaires to flaunt it as the cover car of their garage.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cvk_oneone.jpg alt="Christian von Koenigsegg in standing in front of his Agera RS folding arms and the brand logo behind him on a green background." width=450 height=219 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Remember the brand.</strong><br><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Koenigsegg Official</a></strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Christian, along with his wife as the Chief Operating Officer, runs the company that generated revenue only at certain moments per year in the last 20 years. But with his plan to increase the production numbers of the new cars, his net worth is sure to skyrocket in the coming years.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Patience and dedication were key factors for him to succeed in his passion that many rarely do because they give up after not immediately meeting expectations. But he persevered. He worked really hard too, so much so that he lost all his hair on the head and the eyebrows due to a prolonged stress-related disease called&nbsp;alopecia areata.</p><h2>If He Created Cars in Larger Numbers, Christian von Koenigsegg's Net Worth Would Be Much Higher Than the Current <strong>$100 Million</strong></h2><p>At the age of just 22 years old in 1994, Christian started off on a mission to produce the world's fastest car. He launched the Koenigsegg Project with a friend and his garage in Olofstr√∂m, Sweden, to work on creating it. After <a href=# rel=noopener>two years of figurative designing</a>, the first Koenigsegg car, one Koenigsegg CC prototype, was <a href=# rel=noopener>publicized in 1996</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1996_CvK_CC_Prototyoe.jpg alt="von Koenigsegg sitting beside his grey CC Prototype back in 1996.

The company has come far since then, bringing in millions in one sale event. With only about a couple hundred cars sold, Christian amassed a net worth of <strong>$100 million</strong> as of early 2019.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cc8s_8-719x500.jpg alt="A red Koenigsegg CC8S parked in a concrete floor in front of a wall." width=450 height=312 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>The first Koenigsegg ever sold.</strong><br><strong>Source: Koenigsegg Official</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>As of the most recent news, Koenigsegg launched their latest car, the Koenigsegg Jesko (named after Christian's father, <strong>Jesko von Koenigsegg</strong>), at the 2019 Geneva International Motor Show in March. With a starting price of around <strong>$2.8 million</strong>, all the <a href=# rel=noopener>125 build-slots were sold out</a> within days of unveiling.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dscf1520-1024x682-1553704846.jpg alt="(From left)Jesko (dad), Halldora (wife) and Christian von Koenigsegg in front of the new Koenigsegg Jesko at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show." width=450 height=299 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Millionaires and billionaires are already lined up for the new Koenigsegg Jesko. (Him, his wife and his father at the 2019 Geneva International Motor Show)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Source: Koenigsegg Official</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The fact that they are not even made makes it quite insane. Production begins in early 2020 with a rate of one car per week target. Buyers are from all over the world, meaning right-sided and left-sided, both, cars will be manufactured. The first test drive was taken by Christian von Koenigsegg himself. Check out <a href=#>the details</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Jesko Was Instrumental in Christian's Success, Lending Him Almost $2 Million in the First Decade</h2><p>With no automobile background, knowledge or anything of sorts, but only his passion, he used <strong>$200,000</strong> of his own money in 1994 to begin that earlier ambition. His father was an industrial-heating-tech executive who loaned him <strong>$300,000</strong>. He helped Christian more often and didn't even realize he'd already loaned him <strong>$2 million</strong> by the end of the millennium. That helped massively too.</p><p>He received a <strong>$150,000</strong> loan <a href=# rel=noopener>from the Swedish Board for Technological Development</a> in 1995. After that, he got 20 more investors to chip in <strong>$2 million</strong> more in 1999 and thus was able to produce the CC8S for sale in 2003. He's sold stakes of the company back then. Now he has many millionaire companies as stakeholders.</p><p><strong><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1000x-1.jpg alt="A red Koenigsegg Regera at the factory in Angelholm, all separable parts lifted.." width=450 height=337 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Every car is customized by Koenigsegg.</strong><br><strong>Source: Florian Thoss, Bloomberg Businessweek</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Every car produced is done by the firm's own car parts as they have over 30 patents for them. The company moved its headquarters in 1998 to a farm in Margretetorp, just outside √Ñngelholm. One of the production facilities caught fire on a Saturday in 2003, and they relocated to an abandoned airbase once used by the Swedish Air Force's "Ghost Squadron," in √Ñngelholm. The ghost badge was inspired by the significance of the airbase. They now have 225 workers, but according to their new plan, they might want to increase that number.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p><strong><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Fire.jpg alt="The Factory building's roof burning in blazing fire in Margretetorp." width=455 height=229 sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Despite being a Saturday, the workers were there at the factory to prevent further damage.</strong><br><strong>Source: Koenigsegg Official</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>Over the first decade of 2000, the company intentionally produced cars at a slow rate (20 per year) with 51 total units released by 2010. The 47-year-old tried to obtain <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> worth Sweden's Saab from General Motors in 2009 which fell apart at the last minute after the Swedish government backed out a <strong>$600 million</strong> loan. But they didn't stop producing cars (at the same rate). The revenue was <strong>$17 million</strong> in 2015.</p><p>In January 2019, Chinese-backed <a href=# rel=noopener>National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS) acquired</a> a <strong>‚Ç¨150 million</strong> (around <strong>$171 million</strong>) 20% stake of Koenigsegg Automobiles AB so that they could access their facilities in Trollh√§ttan. Furthermore, NEVS will chip in <strong>$150 million</strong> for a 65% stake while Christian will share his intellectual properties for the remaining 35%.</p><h3>Plans to Increase Productions to Thousands Per Year to Rival the Likes of Ferrari</h3><p>Most big car companies like Ferrari and Lamborghini produce thousands of car units each year. In February, Christian <a href=# rel=noopener>announced the initiative to increase the production numbers</a> to 100s of Koenigseggs per year by 2022. An unnamed 'entry level' car is coming out, each tagged <strong>$1 million</strong> already.</p><p>The proposed model will feature a hybrid V-8 engine that produces 1,050 horsepower. It‚Äôll also cost around $1 million, which, if you think about it, barely counts as an ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù model.</p><p>Moreover, further future plans involve a serious threat to the market of Ferrari, Bugatti, and Lamborghini. The goal is to eventually take that numbers to thousands. Imagine von Koenigsegg's net worth numbers if that goes all according to the plan.</p><h2>His Previous Ideas Were All Mocked Which Are Now Billion-Dollar Worth Patents</h2><p>The guy got his self car-making inspiration from an animated movie at the age of five about a Norwegian bicycle repairman who built a supercar. But he did not start with that idea at first. He went with other technical solutions and designs. At the age of 18, he came up with the Chip Player idea for computer memory chips to store a lot of data. Not one was interested, but we know it is the norm today.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p><strong>Advised to Watch Till the End: Everything He Did to Raise Money for His Ambition!</strong></p><p></p><p>In 1991, he invented a quick fix, called Click, to join floor planks without nails or adhesives. His Belgian father-in-law and other floor manufacturers rejected the idea. In 1995, Click! was patented by a Belgian and a Swedish company which <a href=# rel=noopener>made it worth <strong>$1 billion</strong></a> by 2009. They essentially took it from him.</p><p>It doesn't matter now since his car idea clicked as a legend. Since there were loans in the company's early years, he held only a few percentages of the shares. He estimated eight million shares each worth <strong>$2.50</strong> (total <strong>$20 million</strong>) in 2001 without any debt. After pre-selling his first year's run of 10 cars for <strong>$300,000</strong>, the company went towards profit.</p><p>In 2009, von Koenigsegg held 18% of the shares with Norwegian entrepreneur <strong>B√•rd Ekers</strong> holding the highest 49%. Eventually, when the supercars became such a hype in the early 2010s, he was able to buy the shares back from his investors. By 2016, his holding company has over 80% of the car brand. That is until he sold the 20% share to NEVS.</p><h2>Wife Saved Company Many Times and His Work is His Vacation</h2><p>The entrepreneur is married to his teenage love <strong>Halldora von Koenigsegg,</strong> who is an Icelandic, since 2000. They met in 1991 (he was 19) when they were studying in Brussels, Belgium. They have two kids together. Aside from the household, she also has been instrumental in the company's build-up years ago, when they had to make suppliers wait to get paid. She even <a href=# rel=noopener>begged them not to send them to bankruptcy</a>. She is the current COO and the president of <strong>Alpraaz</strong>, the second company of Christian's first company founded in 1991.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p><strong><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/christian-von-koenigsegg-s-wife-111807_1-1.jpg alt="Christian von Koenigsegg and his wife, Halldora von Koenigsegg looking at the camera above their head while sitting on their red Koenigsegg car." width=455 height=255 sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>"If I‚Äôve saved the company from death 50 times, so has she," Koenigsegg told Sixtysix Magazine</strong><br><strong>Source: Weekend Di</strong></p><p>While the company is in the countryside, their home is five minutes from the beach. That's their only holiday, reading books and stuff. Since he is doing something he loves, he believes he's "never worked a day in my life." He likes to work under pressure, a reason he lost his facial and head hair (the eyebrows are replaced by tattoos).</p><p>They have two sons, <strong>Sebastian</strong>, 15,&nbsp;and <strong>Samuel</strong>, 13.</p><h3>A Look Into Their Garage - They Don't Own a Koenigsegg, but He Drives a Tesla</h3><p>It takes six months to produce a Koenigsegg, and with more demands than Koenigsegg Automobiles AB is allowed to make, it comes to no surprise (to some), the pair don't own a Koenigsegg themselves. Every one of them is sold, even the prototypes.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><p>The Koenigsegg founder drives around in his Tesla Model S P85 that costs less than <strong>$100,000</strong>. He admires the brand and <a href=# rel=noopener>got the idea of 'direct drive' from them</a>. He ordered a Tesla Model 3 back in March 2019 which probably made his garage already. In 2018, he was <a href=# rel=noopener>reunited with his black 1992 Mazda MX-5</a> which he sold ages ago. It's in great condition, but he had to pay extra to get it home.</p><p><strong><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/koenigseggmiata-1-1553702723.png alt="The black Mazda MX from the year 1991 as the two young Koenigseggs are standing beside the car." width=450 height=299 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>His first Mazda Miata came back home last year (what a hair back then!).</strong><br><strong>Source: Christian von Koenigsegg</strong></p><p>Meanwhile, Halldora drives her Volvo XC90 and a Porsche 911 Targa.
