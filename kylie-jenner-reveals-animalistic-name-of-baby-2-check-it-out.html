Kylie Jenner has named her son Aire
The 25-year-old make-up mogul initially announced that she’d named her baby boy Wolf Webster, before having a change of heart – and she’s now taken to social media to confirm his actual name, and to share the first-ever photos of him.
Alongside some behind-the-scenes photos of her baby boy, Kylie wrote on Instagram: “AIRE [heart emoji] (sic)”"><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
