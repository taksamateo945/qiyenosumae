She says that all that talk about romance and love, it’s really got her thinking, Thomas says yeah and Hope says she’s talking about him and this ring.</p><p>Then, they kiss and the implication is she might be finally ready to tell him yes and move forward with an engagement and wedding.</p><p>Thomas and Hope get passionate at work, but that’s certainly not a new thing-that couch in the designing room has gotten a lot of use! The question is, whether Thomas’ dream of marrying Hope is coming true, or whether this whole scenario is a dream?</p><h3>B & B Spoilers: Wedding Bells Ahead?</h3><p>Might there really be wedding bells ahead for Thomas and Hope, in spite of all the family forces trying to keep them apart and all the disapproval?</p><p><img alt="The Bold And The Beautiful: Thomas Forrester’s (Matthew Atkinson)" width=730 height=397 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2024/02/the-bold-and-the-beautiful-spoilers-hopes-delayed-decision-is-thomas-dreaming/ data-jpibfi-post-title="The Bold And The Beautiful Spoilers: Hope’s Delayed Decision, Is Thomas Dreaming?" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BB-Thomas-Forrester.png></p><p><a href=#>Hope’s divorce from Liam Spencer (Scott Clifton) should be final very soon,</a> it’s going on a year since they separated and he’s no longer fighting it.</p><p>In fact, he practically immediately started trying to break up John “Finn” Finnegan (Tanner Novlan) and Steffy Forrester Finnegan (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) thereby proving Hope’s point.</p><p>She grew weary of all the waffling and Liam’s lack of true commitment to her, and wanted a man who only loves and wants her, and she’s found that in Thomas.</p><h3>The Bold And The Beautiful Spoilers: Thomas Forrester’s Dreamed Of This For Years</h3><p>Thomas has dreamed of this for years, and his family members have been concerned that Hope has only been toying with him and would hurt him after making so much progress.</p><p><a href=#>Hope says she trusts him now and feels freely loved</a>, not obsessed over as had happened in the past. Thomas has been extraordinarily patient with Hope, not wanting to rush into anything although he likely would if he could, but he refuses to, not wanting to scare her away.</p><p>He’s been letting her be in control of the flow of their relationship all along, which is wise on his part considering his past obsessive behavior, and sometimes misbehavior.</p><p>Also important to Thomas is making amends and restoring the relationship with his son, Douglas Forrester (Henry Joseph Samiri) so if Hope finally does say yes, Douglas’ feelings will be considered.</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with B & B right now.
