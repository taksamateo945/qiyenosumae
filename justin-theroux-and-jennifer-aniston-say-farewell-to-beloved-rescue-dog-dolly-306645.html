Dolly spent time with both Justin and Jennifer Aniston as a couple and new photos shared from Dolly‚Äôs memorial service have many people believing Jennifer was in attendance. Whether she was there or not, there is no doubt that she was just as emotionally gripped as Justin over the passing of the beautiful white shepherd.</p><p>Justin shared several photos from the service that featured Dolly covered in beautiful flower petals and in one picture, burning sage was visible. It was clear the ceremony was a spiritual one and that Justin was greatly moved over the loss of such a beautiful and powerful creature.</p><p>Sharing six heartbreaking photos, one photo showed a woman holding Justin‚Äôs hand as they both rested their hands on Dolly‚Äôs leg. Many people believe that the woman holding Justin‚Äôs hand in comfort is Jennifer Aniston.</p><p>You may read the caption Justin shared and see the five photos he shared below.</p><p>‚ÄúTonight, at sunset, after a heroic struggle‚Ä¶ our most loyal family member and protector, Dolly A. laid down her sword and shield. üê∫üíî She was surrounded by her entire family. ‚ÄúThe one that never deserts, the one that never proves ungrateful‚Ä¶ is the dog‚Äî faithful and true, even in death.‚Äù<br>-George Vest<br>Rest In Peace Dolly<br>#adoptdontshop<br>#rescuedog.‚Äù</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0fdiDFAczx/</p><p>Though it hasn‚Äôt been 100 percent confirmed the woman holding Justin‚Äôs hand is Jennifer many believe it is her. Jennifer isn‚Äôt on Instagram so the post doesn‚Äôt include a tag featuring Jennifer‚Äôs name and you can‚Äôt see the woman‚Äôs face in the photo. Some say that this is even more proof that is is Jennifer as she guards her privacy and wouldn‚Äôt want the focus on Dolly‚Äôs ceremony to be overshadowed by her presence or rumors about her relationship with Justin.</p><p>Justin is an avid animal lover and frequently shares photos and posts about helping animals on his social media accounts and pointed out that Dolly was a rescue dog.</p><p>Pets become part of our families and losing a pet is just as painful as losing a human loved one. Many of Justin‚Äôs friends reached out on social media to share their condolences.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Our thoughts and prayers are with Justin and Jennifer at this time.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeaqsC1tc1mq6GdoqTCuXnAp5tmopWju6qyxKtkmqaZqMGwuoysmLJllpa%2FpsPEpaNmrJ9ir6a4zq%2BcnWWimsCkwcRmm6ifXZm8rbjYZmppbmZpgnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./star-wars-obi-wan-kenobi-episode-1-and-2-easter-eggs-explained.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi Episode 1 and 2 Easter Eggs Explained</span></a>
