After the Mariners fell just short of making the playoffs in 2023, president of baseball operations Jerry Dipoto was clear-eyed about the offense's role in that.
&#34;If there was a reason why we were sitting home in the postseason,&#34; he said, &#34;we felt like it was probably the inability to consistently make contact."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It's a key factor for why they're only scoring 3.5 runs per game.</p><p>Another key factor, however, is that Julio Rodríguez, Mitch Garver and J.P.

After coughing up a 5.21 ERA in the team's first 12 games, Mariners hurlers have a 1.83 ERA in six games since then. Given the sheer strength of this staff, the latter is more indicative than the former.</p><p>Also in the meantime, the Rangers and Astros are also off to slow starts. As slumps go, this one is well-timed.</p><p><b>Panic Meter: </b>1</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWx%2BeoKMqZinoZNiuqbAxKtksKCZmLVuucubZJynnqmyr7DEq6pmq5ikwq2wjJucZq%2Bfp7%2BqscNmmJunpal6o7HCqKSippdivbOx056lnZ2iqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jay-zs-former-friend-and-associate-claims-he-was-abandoned-by-him-346711.html><span>←</span><span>Jay-Zs Former Friend And Associate Claims He Was Abandoned By Him</span></a>
