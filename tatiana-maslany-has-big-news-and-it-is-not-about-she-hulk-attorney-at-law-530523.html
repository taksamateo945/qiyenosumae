Tim Roth also starred alongside Brendan in Lie To Me.</p><p>The news of their relationship was confirmed when the two first appeared on a red carpet together for A24’s “X.”</p><p>Ever since then the two have been spotted together on multiple occasions, each more wholesome than the last and it only makes sense that the two are now married.
