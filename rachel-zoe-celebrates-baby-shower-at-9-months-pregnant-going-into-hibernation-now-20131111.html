<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Rachel Zoe Has Baby Shower at 9 Months Pregnant, Goes Into Hibernation</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>Rachel Zoe</strong></a> will be welcoming her second child any day now! The 42-year-old fashion designer showed off her baby bump at nine months pregnant in a stunning strapless black gown at the second annual Baby2Baby Gala in Culver City, Calif. on Saturday, Nov. 9. At the event, Zoe chatted with <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> about nearing the end of her pregnancy and her plans to hide out until the baby is born.</p><p>“It’s wonderful. It’s great,” Zoe told Us of her second pregnancy. “I mean, I’m literally 9 months pregnant so this I think will probably be one of my last outings. I’m going into hibernation!”</p><p>“I’m tired,” she added. “It’s really hard to get really dressed up, but it’s like you do it when it’s important and tonight is really important.” (Baby2Baby is an organization that provides baby supplies and clothing to families in need in Los Angeles.)</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Over 40 and pregnant stars</a></p><p>Zoe is already mom to son Skyler, 2, with husband <strong>Rodger Berman</strong>. The celebrity stylist told Us that Skyler is finally getting excited about becoming a big brother. “I think he is getting there,” she explained. “He gets it that there is a baby inside me. It’s taken a while to get him there, but he is getting there.”</p><p>The second-time mom-to-be said she hasn’t set up the nursery yet because she’s “a little superstitious,” but she is planning what ensemble to wear to the hospital during labor.</p><p>“I am actually trying to plan that,” she shared. “I really am actually! You try to stay as chic as long as you can.” But when it comes to trying to lose the baby weight after her second child is born, the famously slim fashionista told Us she won’t be doing anything. “Nothing. Chase a toddler and be a mother,” she said. “Any new mother will tell you don’t have to exercise, you just have to be a mom.&nbsp;Being a mom is the best exercise!”</p><p>The day after the Baby2Baby gala, Zoe attended one last party before officially going into hibernation — her baby shower.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The Rachel Zoe Project star shared photos on <a href=#>Instagram</a> of the Nov. 10 party, which she wrote was hosted by Juicy founder Pamela levy. “My team celebrating with me at my baby shower, love them!” she captioned one photo of herself, wearing a long black dress, while posing with a group of ladies.</p><p>Zoe’s good pal <a href=#><strong>Nicole Richie</strong></a> appeared to be in attendance at the event. The 32-year-old fashion designer and mother of two shared a photo of herself on <a href=#>Instagram</a> with the <a href=#>same party setup</a> in the background as some of Zoe’s photos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Many sites are speculating that the shower suggests Zoe is having a baby boy. Blue napkins were used at the dining tables, and gold and silver balloons in the letters “B,” “O” and “Y” can be spotted in snapshots.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKmam5iauW7Gzp5knJ2cmq%2BzrdOeqmaakZfGbr%2FHqK6eql2WwW6FjKamp6yYqHqxvsSgpZqmpGK0sLXNoGSipqSkeqm1wZ6pp5mknryvec2ormZqYGaAcn2Qag%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./172831-young-man-kills-mnike-dance-challenge-major-league-djz-concert-tiktok-video-clocks-31m-views.html><span>←</span><span>Young Man Kills Mnike Dance Challenge at Major League DJz Concert, TikTok Video Clocks 3.1M Vi</span></a>
