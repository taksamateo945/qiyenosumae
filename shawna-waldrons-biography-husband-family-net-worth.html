Also, she secured the recurring role of Bonnie Stiles in yet another comedy series, “Ladies Man” (1999-2000).

She didn’t have much success in the 2000s as an actress, making it hard for her to continue her <a rel=nofollow href=#>career</a>, however, she was Azalea in the television film “Poison Ivy: The Secret Society” in 2008, and Amanda in the drama film “3 Days in L.A.” in 2009.</p><p>Since 2010, Shawna hasn’t been quite so active as an actress, but still made a few notable appearances.
